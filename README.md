# SocialDistanceCVML

## Overview
SocialDistanceCVML is a collection of Python scripts designed to detect adherence to social distancing protocols during pandemic situations such as COVID-19. These scripts utilize simple machine learning models, specifically haar cascades, to perform tasks such as counting and tracking people in various environments. The primary goal is to assess and ensure that social distancing measures are being followed effectively.

## Features
- **People Detection**: Accurately identifies individuals in crowded areas.
- **Distance Measurement**: Calculates the distance between individuals to ensure they are maintaining safe distances.
- **Tracking**: Keeps track of individual movements over time.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For writing scripts and handling data.
- Haar Cascades: For detection and tracking purposes.
